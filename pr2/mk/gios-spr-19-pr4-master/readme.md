# RPC: Remote Procedure Call

## Foreword

In this project, you will work with Remote Procedure Calls,
specifically with Sun RPC. The RPC server will accept a jpeg image as input,
downsample it to a lower resolution, and return the resulting image.

## Setup

You can clone the code in the project 4 repository with the command

```
git clone https://github.gatech.edu/gios-spr-19/pr4.git
```

## Submission Instructions

All code should be submitted through the `submit.py` script given at the top level
of the corresponding folder in the repository.  For instructions on how to
submit individual components of the assignment see the instructions below.

> For this assignment, you may submit your code up to 10 times in a 24 hour
> period. After the deadline, we download your last submission prior to the
> deadline, review your submission and assign a grade. There is no limit to the
> number of times you may submit your `readme-student.md` file.

After submitting, you may double-check the results of your submission by
visiting the [Udacity/GT autograding website](https://bonnie.udacity.com) and
going to the student portal.

## README

Throughout the project, we encourage you to keep notes on what you have done,
how you have approached each part of the project and what resources you used in
preparing your work.  We have provided you with a prototype file,
`readme-student.md` that you should use throughout the project.

You may submit your `readme-student.md` file with the command:

```
python submit.py readme
```

At the prompt, please provide your GT username and password.

If this is your first time submitting, the program will then ask you if you want
to save the `jwt`.  If you reply yes, it will save a token on your filesystem so
that you don't have to provide your username and password each time that you
submit.

The Udacity site will store your `readme-student.md` file in a database.  This
will be used during grading.  The submit script will acknowledge receipt of your
README file. For this project, like in Project 3, you only need to submit one
README file for both parts of the project.

> Note: you may choose to submit a PDF version of this file instead,
> `readme-student.pdf` in addition to the markdown version.  The submission
> script will automatically detect and submit this file, if it is present in the
> project root directory.  If you submit both files, we will give the PDF version
> preference.

## Directions

Begin programming by modifying only the files specified below.

### Part 1 - Building a Single-Threaded RPC Server

Your first task will be to define the RPC interface through the XDR file
`minifyjpeg.x`.  The syntax and semantics of these file types are explained in
the course videos as well as the documentation for `rpcgen`.

The `rpcgen` tool will generate much of the C code that you will need.

> You should use the -MN option for the "multi-threaded" support and the “newer”
> rpc style that allows for multiple arguments.

In the generated file `minifyjpeg.h`, you will find the definitions of
functions that you will need to implement.  On the server side, you need to take
the input image, reduce its resolution by a factor of 2, and return the result.
A library that does this with ImageMagick is provided in the files
`magickminify.[ch]`. For the sake of this project only JPEG (JPG) images will
be used.

On the client side, the provided file `minifyjpeg_main.c` acts as a workload
generator for the RPC server.  It calls two functions which you should implement
in the `minify_via_rpc.c` file.

- `get_minify_client` - should connect to the rpc server and return
  the CLIENT\* pointer.

- `minify_via_rpc` - should call the remote procedure on the client specified as
  a parameter.

In order to support **images of arbitrary size** and not worry about
implementing packet ordering, the communication should use TCP as the transport
protocol. Keep in mind that you should not be limiting the size of the image
file. This means you have to pay attention to how you define the data structures
in your **".x"** file to support files of any size.

Here is a summary of the relevant files and their roles.

- `rpc/Makefile` - (do not modify) file used to compile the code.  Run ‘make
  minifyjpeg_main’  and ‘make minifyjpeg_svc’ to compile the client and server
  programs.

- `rpc/magickminify.[ch]` - (do not modify) a library with a simple interface
  that downsamples jpeg files to half their original resolution.

- `rpc/minify_via_rpc.c` - **(modify)** implement the client-side functions
  here so that the client sends the input file to server for downsampling.

- `rpc/minifyjpeg.h` - **(to be generated by rpcgen from minifyjpeg.x and
  modified by you)** you will need to implement the server-side functions
  listed here in minifyjpeg.c

- `rpc/minifyjpeg.c` - **(modify)** implement the needed server-side function
  here.

- `rpc/minifyjpeg.x` - **(modify)** define the RPC/XDR interface here.

- `rpc/minifyjpeg_clnt.c` - **(to be generated by rpcgen from minifyjpeg.x and
  modified by you)** contains the client side code that executes the RPC call.

- `rpc/minifyjpeg_main.c` - (do not modify) a workload generator for the RPC
  server.

- `rpc/minifyjpeg_svc.c` - **(to be generated by rpcgen from minifyjpeg.x and
  modified by you)** this contains the entry point for the server code.  You
  will need to modify this file to make your code **multithreaded.**

- `rpc/minifyjpeg_xdr.c` - **(to be generated by rpcgen from minifyjpeg.x and
  modified by you)** contains code related to data structures defined in
  minifyjpeg.x

- `workload/workload.txt` - (modify for your own testing purposes) an example
  workload file that can be passed into the client main program
  minifyjpeg_main.c

- `workload/input` - (modify for your own testing purposes) the input directory
  for images listed in the `workload.txt` file.

- `workload/output` - the output directory for minimized images returned via RPC

#### Submitting Part 1

You may submit your **Part 1** implementation with the following command:

```
python submit.py rpc
```

### Part 2 - Building a Multi-Threaded RPC Server

For part 2, you will modify the server-side file `rpc-mt/minifyjpeg_svc.c` to make
the server multithreaded.

**For Part 2, you should work with the files located under the `rpc-mt` folder.**

The descriptions of these files are the same as Part 1.

#### A few notes about the multithreaded RPC development project:

##### `svc_getargs`

It's important to note that the `svc_getargs` function copies global data from
the rpc library into memory that you control.  Therefore, this must be done
before the function registered with `svc_register` returns or that data will
not be available. The function `svc_sendreply` can be called later.

##### `main`

You will need to change the `minifyjpeg_svc.c` main method to accept a
command-line parameter (-t) to indicate the number of threads to be created.
This will be similar to what you have done in P1 and P3 when it comes to
creating a pool of threads. You can copy the argument parsing logic from one of
those earlier projects, or you can write your own.

In either case your `minifyjpeg_svc.c` main function will receive a command
line parameter (-t) to indicate the number of threads to be used. The
autograder will test to ensure you are creating the requested number of
threads.

The syntax used to run the service will be: ``` minify_svc -t X ``` Where **X**
is the number of threads to be created by the main method. No other
command-line parameters will be passed to it, so you can write your code
assuming that you only need to handle that parameter.

#### Submitting Part 2

You may submit your **Part 2** implementation with the following command:

```
python submit.py rpc_mt
```

For further research, if you would like to see where RPC came from and where it's
going with newer protocols such as gRPC, then the following article may be of
some interest to you: [RPC is Not Dead: Rise, Fall, and the Rise of Remote Procedure Calls](http://dist-prog-book.com/chapter/1/rpc.html).

### Project Design Recommendations

When testing and debugging, start with running small/light client workloads. If
your server is slow in responding, you may start timing out at the TCP socket
and then the RPC runtime layer -- thus, look for options to change the timeout
values used with RPCs.

For the timeout test, you need to make sure that you modify the default timeout
value that is generated by RPC as it is larger than the timeout value for the
grader. Next you need to detect the timeout condition and return the appropriate
code (*hint* look at the return codes from RPC and return the one that indicates
a timeout).

> **NOTE:** RPC will setup a default timeout value in the `minifyjpeg_clnt.c` file.
> This file is generated each time you run `rpcgen` and the default value put back
> in place. The `minifyjpeg_clnt.c` file has a comment with a hint on how to set the
> timeout programmatically, so that it doesn't get overwritten.

### RPCBind Notes

If you find you are getting errors such as **RPC: unable to receive**
or **Cannot register service**, then the rpcbind service may not have started. You
can try any of the following in your virtual environment.

```
# OPTIMAL: Ensure the service is started
# note that both of these do the same thing on Ubuntu 18.04
sudo systemctl start rpcbind
sudo service rpcbind start

# Probe the rpcbind host - tends to kick it off
rpcinfo -p

# Run it in the background
sudo rpcbind &
```

## Rubric

Your project will be graded _at least_ on the following items:

- Interface specification (.x)
- Service implementation
- RPC initiation and binding
- Proper clean up of memory and RPC resources
- Proper communication with the server
- Proper handling of a server that takes too long to complete the request. The
  client should time out after between 5 and 10 seconds
- Insightful observations in the Readme file and suggestions for improving the
  class for future semesters

### RPC Single-Threaded (40 points)

### RPC Multi-Threaded (50 points)

### Readme file (10 points)
